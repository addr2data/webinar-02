A series of AWS webinars
========================

Three goals
-----------

- Walk through the basic configuration of a significant number of AWS services over 4-5 webinars.

	+ Each webinar building on the previous ones.

- Provide an opportunity for attendees to develop **hands-on-literacy** with AWS services (in three steps):

	+ **See** - Expose attendees to AWS services/components/concepts using the AWS console (**webinar**).

	+ **Do** - Allow attendees to recreate the steps from the webinar using the awscli (**goingCmdO**).

	+ **Explore** - Allow attendees to become familiar with using the AWS APIs directly (**code samples**)

- **NO SLIDES** - content is publicly available on GitHub.

	+ This session is available at **https://github.com/addr2data/webinar-02**.
